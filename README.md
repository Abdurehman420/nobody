# NEON MYCELIUM

> "It's not a bug, it's a feature. And that feature is a tumor named Gary."

Neon Mycelium is a psychedelic, idle-incremental strategy game about managing a cosmic fungal network, dealing with bureaucratic nightmares, and enduring the constant mockery of your own UI.

## 🌟 Core Features

### The Network
*   **Procedural Node Generation:** Grow your mycelial network across an infinite void.
*   **Fluid Simulation:** Resources (Stardust, Flux, Lucidity) flow through connections like liquid.
*   **Infinite Zoom:** Scroll forever. The universe is fractal.
*   **Dimensional Shifts:** Unlock new dimensions (Mirror Realm, Glitch Dimension) that alter physics and visuals.

### The Economy
*   **Stardust:** The raw matter of the universe. Used to build nodes.
*   **Flux:** The energy of connection. Generated by flow.
*   **Lucidity:** The currency of awareness. Used for upgrades and dealing with... things.
*   **Sunk Cost Pit:** A literal bottomless pit where you can throw your resources away for absolutely no reward. (Now emoji-free!)

## 🤡 The "Silly" Addons (Module F & Beyond)

This game is packed with "features" designed to troll, confuse, or mildly inconvenience you.

### UI & Interaction
*   **Gary the Tumor:** Your sentient, sarcastic AI companion who hates you. He pulses, he grumbles, he judges your APM.
*   **Banana for Scale:** A photorealistic banana that floats across the screen. Hover over objects to see their size in Bananas (to 5 decimal places!).
*   **Squishy Buttons:** Every button wobbles, bounces, or resists being clicked.
*   **Smart Cursor:** A cursor that gets bored, wanders off, or actively avoids the button you're trying to click.
*   **Winamp Visualizer:** A fully functional, nostalgic audio visualizer that reacts to the game's soundtrack.
*   **TOS Monolith:** A massive, scrolling Terms of Service agreement that physically blocks your view until you "agree" (or destroy it).
*   **Captcha Checkpoint:** Randomly asks you to prove you aren't a robot by solving impossible philosophical questions.
*   **Copyright Strike:** A fake legal overlay that claims you've infringed on "The Concept of Circles."
*   **Heat Death Countdown:** A timer counting down to the end of the universe. Don't worry, it's very long.

### Entities & Encounters
*   **Hate Mail:** Receive angry letters from microscopic civilizations you accidentally crushed.
*   **Generic NPCs:** Untextured, grey humanoids that wander the void, T-posing and muttering Skyrim quotes.
*   **Emotional Baggage:** Literal suitcases that drift by. If you don't repress them, they make you sad.
*   **Schrödinger's Catbox:** A vibrating box. Is the cat alive? Dead? Both? Click to find out (and maybe explode).
*   **Spaghetti Code Tangles:** Glitchy masses of neon wire that scramble your resource packets.
*   **Wet Floor Zones:** Yellow caution areas that muffle all game audio to an underwater "glug-glug" sound.
*   **Time Traveler's Regret:** Paradox entities that try to delete your source node to prevent their own creation.
*   **Sentient Mold Neighbor:** A neighbor who borrows your sugar (Flux) and never returns it.
*   **Paid Promotion Blimp:** A giant blimp advertising fake products like "Gluten-Free Dark Matter."

### Systems & Mechanics
*   **Bureaucracy Mode:** Fill out tax forms (Form 27B-6) to legalize your illegal node placements.
*   **Cheat Cartridges:** Physical NES-style cartridges you have to "blow on" (click rapidly) to activate cheats like "Big Head Mode" or "Disco Floor."
*   **Konami Code:** Up, Up, Down, Down... you know the rest. Unlocks "God Mode" (or does it?).
*   **Flooble Clank:** A machine that does nothing but make a "Flooble" sound and a "Clank" sound. You can upgrade it to be louder.
*   **Philosopher's Stone:** Transmutes Lead into Gold, but mostly just complains about the price of reagents.
*   **NFT Collection:** A gallery of procedurally generated "Non-Fungible Toadstools" that you can't actually sell.
*   **Backseat Gamer:** A disembodied voice that criticizes your strategy ("You missed a spot", "My grandma plays faster").
*   **Interdimensional Customs:** Randomly stops your resource packets for "inspection."
*   **Reply All Disaster:** A simulated email storm that lags your UI with corporate buzzwords.
*   **Censored Pipe:** A pipe that is pixelated and beeps whenever resources flow through it.
*   **Recursive Review Loop:** A modal that asks you to review the review modal.

## 🎧 Audio Experience
*   **Procedural Soundtrack:** Generative ambient music that evolves with your network.
*   **ASMR Mode:** "Dump and Pleasant" sound design. Low-frequency thuds, warm hums, and zero high-pitched beeps.
*   **Audio Ducking:** The music politely lowers its volume when Gary speaks (or when you step on a wet floor).
*   **Interdimensional Radio:** A fully functional radio widget featuring:
    *   **Real Streams:** Direct integration with **Radio Garden** and **SomaFM** (Space Station, Drone Zone, etc.).
    *   **Synth Stations:** Procedurally generated stations (Pink Noise, Brown Noise) for pure focus.
    *   **Independent Volume:** Listen to the radio even when the main game is muted.
    *   **"Space?" Station:** Now fixed and broadcasting from the void.
    *   **Pyongyang FM:** Yes, you can stream the only and official North Korean radio station in-game. Don't ask why.

## 🛠 Technical Details
*   **Custom Engine:** Built from scratch in React + Canvas API.
*   **No Libraries:** (Almost) zero dependencies. Physics, particles, and audio synthesis are all hand-rolled.
*   **Robust Physics:** Fluid simulation now includes a "Warm-Up" phase on load to ensure instant pressure propagation, plus NaN safety checks and case-insensitive node handling.
*   **Save System:** Auto-saves every 5 seconds and immediately upon tab closure. Your progress is safe from the void.
*   **Spaghetti Code:** Intentionally authentic. (Gary's eye-tracking is now throttled to prevent recursive crashes, because even spaghetti has limits).
